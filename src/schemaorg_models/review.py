class Review(CreativeWork):
    '''
    A review of an item - for example, of a restaurant, movie, or store.

    Attributes:
        itemReviewed: The item that is being reviewed/rated.
        positiveNotes: Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside [[negativeNotes]]) pro/con lists for reviews.

In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list).
        reviewAspect: This Review or Rating is relevant to this part or facet of the itemReviewed.
        reviewRating: The rating given in this review. Note that reviews can themselves be rated. The ```reviewRating``` applies to rating given by the review. The [[aggregateRating]] property applies to the review itself, as a creative work.
        associatedReview: An associated [[Review]].
        associatedClaimReview: An associated [[ClaimReview]], related by specific common content, topic or claim. The expectation is that this property would be most typically used in cases where a single activity is conducting both claim reviews and media reviews, in which case [[relatedMediaReview]] would commonly be used on a [[ClaimReview]], while [[relatedClaimReview]] would be used on [[MediaReview]].
        negativeNotes: Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside [[positiveNotes]]). For symmetry 

In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).
        reviewBody: The actual body of the review.
        associatedMediaReview: An associated [[MediaReview]], related by specific common content, topic or claim. The expectation is that this property would be most typically used in cases where a single activity is conducting both claim reviews and media reviews, in which case [[relatedMediaReview]] would commonly be used on a [[ClaimReview]], while [[relatedClaimReview]] would be used on [[MediaReview]].
