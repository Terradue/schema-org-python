    '''
    A ProductGroup represents a group of [[Product]]s that vary only in certain well-described ways, such as by [[size]], [[color]], [[material]] etc.

While a ProductGroup itself is not directly offered for sale, the various varying products that it represents can be. The ProductGroup serves as a prototype or template, standing in for all of the products who have an [[isVariantOf]] relationship to it. As such, properties (including additional types) can be applied to the ProductGroup to represent characteristics shared by each of the (possibly very many) variants. Properties that reference a ProductGroup are not included in this mechanism; neither are the following specific properties [[variesBy]], [[hasVariant]], [[url]]. 

    Attributes:
        variesBy: Indicates the property or properties by which the variants in a [[ProductGroup]] vary, e.g. their size, color etc. Schema.org properties can be referenced by their short name e.g. "color"; terms defined elsewhere can be referenced with their URIs.
        hasVariant: Indicates a [[Product]] that is a member of this [[ProductGroup]] (or [[ProductModel]]).
        productGroupID: Indicates a textual identifier for a ProductGroup.
