    '''
    A reservation to dine at a food-related business.\
\
Note: This type is for information about actual reservations, e.g. in confirmation emails or HTML pages with individual confirmations of reservations.

    Attributes:
        partySize: Number of people the reservation should accommodate.
        endTime: The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.\
\
Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
        startTime: The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip within a larger file.\
